## Developers

### No config.json ? 🕵️‍♀️

This public repo is missing `config.json`, which contains the oauth token, which is required to start developing roby. You can get a copy by asking `@matlo` on the server.

### Install

Roby is writted in nodejs, using the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome) library. To start developing:

```npm install```

then

```npm start```

cheers
